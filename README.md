## Implementation

## Installation

### VSCode

If using VSCode, it is important to install the [vscode_deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) extension from the Extensions page in the text editor. ([deno docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/))

Once the extension is installed, run the following command to interact with the application as you are programming:

  ```bash
  deno run -A --watch main.ts
  ```
