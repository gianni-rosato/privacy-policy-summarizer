## Installation

> Note: If using VSCode, it is important to install the
> [vscode_deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
> extension from the Extensions page in the text editor.
> ([deno docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/))

Once the extension is installed, run the following command to interact with the
application as you are programming:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --watch main.ts
```

If completions aren't working, ensure you have a `.env` file formatted like so:
```ini
API_KEY=...
```
