          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The primary function of our <a href="/">Summarization Tool</a> is to
            make lengthy, difficult-to-read privacy disclosures more accessible.
            You can enter helpful information that you would like the Generative
            AI system to consider, and the output will use the input information
            to try to be more helpful. The tool asks for some inputs that are
            outlined below.
          </p>

          <h3
            class="text-xl mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200"

            Age
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            As outlined by our Terms of Use, you must be 18 years of age or
            older to use this tool. However, you are free to enter any age you
            wish - the age you pass to the tool will pass to the Generative AI
            backend to help it form a more relevant summary for your input age.
          </p>

            Level of Education
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            This dropdown menu allows you to select a relevant Level of
            Education. The options provided are "Graduate", "College", "High
            School", "Middle School", "Elementary School", and "Undetermined".
            For the most personally relevant output, we encourage selecting the
            highest level of education completed, if possible; as with the Age
            input, you do not need to provide your actual level of education.
          </p>

            Privacy Understanding (1-10)
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The Privacy Understanding scale allows you to indicate your
            familiarity with privacy policies and data protection concepts on a
            scale of 1 to 10. A rating of 1 indicates very limited knowledge of
            privacy concepts, while 10 indicates expert-level understanding.
            This helps the AI tailor explanations to your comfort level — for
            example, someone rating themselves as a 2 may receive explanations
            that replace technical terms with conceptual explanations, while
            someone rating themselves as a 9 might receive a response that makes
            liberal use of technical terminology.

            Comparison Tool Overview
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The Comparison Tool allows you to compare the contents of two
            privacy policies.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The Comparison Tool is designed to allow you to compare the contents
            of two privacy policies. There are a number of services available on
            the Web that have varying degrees of privacy awareness — an example
            is DuckDuckGo, which aims to be a privacy-conscious alternative to
            Google Search with clear claims upfront about minimal user tracking.
            Other services are less explicit about their privacy impact versus
            that of their competitors; an example would be Uber versus Lyft, two
            ridesharing services where neither service markets itself as being
            more privacy conscious than the other. The Comparison Tool aims to
            be helpful in either scenario.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The Comparison Tool is informed by an identical set of parameters
            that you are able to supply via the Comparison Tool's page. The one
            additional input compared to the Summary Tool is another text box
            for a privacy policy input that allows you to provide two policies
            for comparison instead of just one like the Summarization Tool.
